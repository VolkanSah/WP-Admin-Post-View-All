#### Helpful tools for your wordpress website.

If you create websites or plugins, sometimes ou create an wrong loop and you submit something and you get an error like 2500 Published and 2500 Draft posts, thats hard to delete them again. ok you can go on your server or in your database and make it more worst or you can use this plugin to let you show alle in a overview you want. i have test it and till 500  Posts its ok, but takes a wille to load the site.. for better experience its settet to 200 use it not on a shared host, ther you can use maximum 50..
